Understanding crime and policing in Boston

This code is part of an ongoing project to visualize police data on crime in Boston using ggplot for visualization. To view these data on an interactive map, visit the project on ArcGIS Online https://arcg.is/1j5T11

Future efforts will focus on analyzing the contributory factors that lead to overpolicing in Boston.
