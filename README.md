Understanding crime and policing in Boston

This code is part of an ongoing project to visualize police data on crime in Boston using ggplot for visualization. To view these data on an interactive map, visit the project on ArcGIS Online https://arcg.is/1j5T11

Given that this is part of an ongoing project, I ask that any use of this code follows the attribution-only version of the creative commons license. Please link back to this repository.
